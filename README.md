CCGetter is a console application for Windows and Linux (both x64) that pulls a list of prevalent **command-and-control** hosts and similar malware related infrastructure.

The list is updated frequently (in average every 15min) and contains only host which we have seen in the last six month.

## Example Data

Examples for malware infrastructure host:

```none
